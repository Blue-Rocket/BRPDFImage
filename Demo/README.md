BRPDFImage Demo
===============

This folder contains a small iPhone/iPad app that runs on iOS
5.1.1 or later. It will render a `UITableView` (iOS < 6) or a
`UICollectionView` (iOS >= 6) full of some randomly tinted PDF icons.
The icons come courtesy of [Font
Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) (thanks, Dave,
you're awesome).

To run, open the `Demo.xcworkspace` in Xcode, build, and enjoy!
